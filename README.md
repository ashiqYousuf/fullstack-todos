# Simple TODO Web App
This is a simple TODO web application built using Django and React. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks. This application does not have any authentication features, so anyone who has access to the URL can access the application.

# Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to have Django and Node.js installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository
In the frontend directory, run npm install to install the required dependencies for the React front-end
In the backend directory, run python manage.py migrate to set up the database
In the backend directory, run python manage.py runserver to start the Django server
In another terminal window, go to the root directory and run npm start to start the React development server
You should now be able to access the TODO application by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

# Usage
* You can add a task
* You can edit a task
* You can remove  a task

* You can add due date of the todos also

# Technologies Used
